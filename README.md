Philosophy: A Fading Subject? How can Universities Adapt to Philosophy’s Change in Popularity?
Authors: Yihan(Andrew) Chen, Thy Pham

Abstract:

Universities need to continuously adjust their course offerings and programs to cater to the changing demand of incoming students every year. 
To advise universities on how to scale their philosophy department and programs, we discover the future of the philosophy’s popularity through forecasting. 
We predict the popularity values for the search term “philosophy” on google for every month in the year of 2016 based on the data we have from the year 2004 to 2015 using time series analysis. 
Then we compare those predictions to the actual values from the year 2016 to judge the prediction model’s accuracy. 
Finally, we predict the popularity values of every month in 2025 to forecast the future of the subject’s popularity. 
When we predicted the 2016 popularity values, they all were within 0 to 5 points of the actual values in 2016. 
When we continued to forecast results to 2025, we found the numbers to all be below 50. Over time, the popularity of the search term “philosophy” decreases, and implies a declining interest in the subject. 
This supports the idea that universities should be sizing down their philosophy departments and decreasing the number of philosophy courses.
